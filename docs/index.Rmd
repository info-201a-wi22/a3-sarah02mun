## Introduction

This report summarizes my exploration of the Vera Institute's data set, which analyzes the population of incarcerated peoples between the years of 1970 and 2018. Through this analysis, 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
